Open Prescribing ,https://openprescribing.net/,"Every month, the NHS in England publishes anonymised data about the drugs prescribed by GPs. But the raw data files are large and unwieldy, with more than 600 million rows. We're making it easier for GPs, managers and everyone to explore - supporting safer, more efficient prescribing.",EBM DATA LAB,"The EBM Data Lab is a range of projects being designed and built by Dr Ben Goldacre and Anna Powell-Smith at the University of Oxford, with colleagues across the university and around the world.

We have set out to create interesting, innovative, live, impactful projects using academic and health data. We publish academic papers. But we think academics should collaborate outside academia, and work with data in ways that go beyond static PDFs in academic journals.

We are based in the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, in the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, in the University of Oxford.",http://www.hscic.gov.uk/gpprescribingdata,https://ebmdatalab.net/images/portfolio/openprescribing.png
clinical calculator API,api.clinicalcalculator.org (API only) ,"We created a REST API which conceals some of the complexity of open data, by removing some of the need to understand the document structure, geographical jargon, and clinical meaning of the raw open data, and enabling simple access to  relevant portions of the data.

As an example, the open data on prevalence of obesity is available as a large Excel file from http://www.noo.org.uk/visualisation. It's organised by region, by LSOA, and MSOA, and by electoral ward (geographical jargon). We felt that many people would want to search by postcode, in order to discover the prevalence of obesity in their area. We therefore used MySociety's MapIt postcode data API https://mapit.mysociety.org/ to return the Ward/MSOA/LSOA for a given postcode, and them used this to look up the relevant information and return it as a JSON response.

To return to what the illustrious David Miller refers to as 'That Old Chestnut' - Clinical Calculator API also provides height centile, weight centile and BMI centile data, used for assessing child growth, general health, and (increasingly) obesity. This is NOT open data, although it definitely should be. In the USA it is open data. http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/percentile_data_files.htm

I suggest trying to use the API from Postman with the following example queries:

Centile: GET http://api.clinicalcalculator.org/centile?weight_in_kg=29&height_in_m=1.20&year_of_birth=2006&month_of_birth=11&day_of_birth=10&sex=M

Obesity Data: GET http://api.clinicalcalculator.org/obesity_by_postcode?postcode_search=wn72nx
