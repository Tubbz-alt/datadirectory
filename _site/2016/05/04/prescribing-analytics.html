      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
      We combined raw prescription data with expert guidance from qualified doctors and medical researchers, cross-checked against NICE guidelines and other best practice, to develop reasonable assumptions about where prescribing choices may be driving excess spending. We investigated statins as the first area to look at, since the guidance is generally straightforward in that area and well-documented: in almost all cases, generic simvastatin is the recommended best-value option, and is enormously chea

        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>
          This matters for two reasons. First, our findings should ring alarm bells about how doctors in England make choices about how they prescribe. We discuss this below.
Second, money available for healthcare is not limitless. Wasteful spending on unnecessary expensive drugs mean that, elsewhere in the NHS, patients are missing out. Maybe another nurse could be employed or a patient could be given a treatment that is currently unaffordable.
Dr James Moon, a cardiologist, has calculated that the NHS could save £1.4bn per year if doctors switched patients from expensive medicines to cheap ones that are just as good.

      <h5>More about Prescribing Analytics</h5>
      This site is the first joint venture of a group of NHS doctors, academics, and London tech start-ups, individually listed below, who met at NHS Hack Day. We love open data, technology, and the NHS, and we think that bringing all of these together in the right way could be amazing. Email us at info@prescribinganalytics.com if you’d like to talk.
