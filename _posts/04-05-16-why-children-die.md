Every year it is estimated that 1,951 additional children – around 5 a day – die in the UK compared to Europe’s best performing country for child mortality, Sweden. The College is committed to reducing childhood mortality in the UK, ensuring all infants, children, young people, and their families are resourced and supported to survive and thrive.
By working with child health experts to review existing evidence and through working in partnership with the National Children’s Bureau we have developed key policy recommendations to tackle premature mortality.
