RSA OPSN collated publically available data and worked with academic colleagues at the University of Surrey to band CCGs based on the experiences of mental health service users in their area. RSA OPSN have banded them ‘low’, ‘as expected’ and ‘high’ based on our expected outcomes adjusted for population. While these bandings provide an important basis of understanding national trends and where particular attention is required, it is important to note whether ‘as expected’, ‘low’ or ‘high’, across all indicators and all bandings, the gap between mental health service users and the rest of the population is stark and concerning.

The data we have found confirms and specifies in greater detail the differing quality as and outcome of life for those with poor mental health. We have found across the country that those with mental illnesses are more likely to die earlier and more like to get treated differently by health care professionals.



## Datasets used
